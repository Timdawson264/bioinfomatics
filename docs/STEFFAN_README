So this is how it works... Hopefully its working right.
We get about 3078 matches for variancecs inside exonic regions.

check_exons.py 
	USAGE: python check_exons.py exons_clean_sorted.txt sickle.test
- Reads in a file containing the exonic regions, and one of the matching variants detected by Tim's C code.
- Exonic region input should be formatted like
	CHROMOSOME	STARTPOS	ENDPOS
- Both input files should be sorted by chromosome

remove_irrelevant_exonic.awk 
- Removes everything but Chromosome, Startpos, and Endpos for exonic regions.
- You should sort the output of this awk program by chromosome number.
- Sorting can be done by:
	sort -k1 -n FILENAME

A sorted, cleaned up exon file has already been made (exons_clean_sorted.txt)
